- Please note that for certain degree programmes further special documents (e.g. English language skills, internships, application for suitability exam) must be submitted. Please familiarise yourself prior to applying by reading the corresponding pages in TU Dresden’s [Student Information System](https://tu-dresden.de/studium/vor-dem-studium/studienangebot/sins).

> *Attention! Never submit the original certificates. Please only hand in officially authenticated copies. Your application documents will remain with uni assist for documentation purposes and will not be returned. We also recommend taking at least one or two additional copies of your officially authenticated application documents with you to Germany. You might require them for other purposes. Authentication of foreign-language documents in Germany requires a lot of effort and is very time-consuming.*
